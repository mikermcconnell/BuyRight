## 📋 Status Updates Protocol
**IMPORTANT**: After completing each task, always update the project status in two places:
1. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Mark the specific task as completed and update progress
2. **CLAUDE.md** - Update the "Current Task" and "Current Development Status" sections

This ensures continuity across development sessions and accurate progress tracking.

## Immediate Next Steps for Task 3.1
1. Create global journey progress state management system
2. Implement progress persistence logic with localStorage/database sync
3. Add React Context for journey progress tracking
4. Create utilities for step completion and progress calculations
5. Integrate with existing journey engine for seamless progress updates

## Feature Interactions & Data Flow

### Context Architecture Overview
The BuyRight app uses a three-layer context architecture for state management:

1. **RegionalContext** - Location-based content management
2. **JourneyContext** - Progress tracking and journey engine 
3. **UserContext** - User profile management (planned - currently localStorage)

### Data Flow Patterns

#### Regional Context Flow
```
RegionalProvider → currentRegion → JourneyProvider → dashboard/components
    ↓                    ↓              ↓
localStorage      regionalContent   customized steps
    ↓                    ↓              ↓  
optimized cache   tax calculations  region-specific resources
```

#### Journey Context Flow
```
JourneyProvider → JourneyEngine → Dashboard/Steps
     ↓               ↓              ↓
ProgressPersistence → localStorage → API sync (offline-first)
     ↓               ↓              ↓
step completion   progress calc   context updates
```

### Key Integration Points

#### 1. Regional + Journey Integration
- `JourneyContext.useEffect` listens to `currentRegion` changes
- `JourneyEngine` receives `currentRegion` to customize journey phases
- Regional content provides `steps`, `costs`, and `legalRequirements`
- Journey engine merges base template with regional overrides

#### 2. Dashboard Integration Pattern
- Uses both `useJourney()` and `useJourneyProgress()` hooks
- Displays progress from JourneyContext state 
- Shows financial insights from CalculatorIntegrationService
- Updates progress through context actions (`completeStep`, `setCurrentStep`)

#### 3. Persistence Strategy (Offline-First)
- **Primary**: localStorage for immediate access
- **Secondary**: API sync when online (via ProgressPersistence service)
- **Fallback**: Offline queue for failed API calls
- **Recovery**: Auto-sync when connection restored

#### 4. Progress Calculation Flow
```
UserJourneyProgress → JourneyEngine.calculateProgress() → Dashboard display
completedSteps → availableSteps → currentStep → progressPercentage
```

### State Dependencies

#### Critical Dependencies
1. **RegionalContext must initialize first** - Journey depends on currentRegion
2. **Journey engine requires regional content** - For step customization
3. **Progress persistence requires userId** - Currently uses 'demo-user'
4. **Calculator integration is loosely coupled** - Separate service layer

#### Context Interaction Rules
- RegionalContext is provider-independent (no auth needed)
- JourneyContext depends on RegionalContext for initialization
- Both contexts use localStorage for demo mode
- Progress updates trigger both context state + persistence layer

### Data Synchronization
- **Regional content**: Optimized loading with caching (`loadRegionalContentOptimized`)
- **Journey progress**: Enhanced persistence with offline queue (`ProgressPersistence`)
- **Context updates**: Real-time via useReducer actions
- **API integration**: Background sync with graceful degradation

### Hook Usage Patterns
```typescript
// For dashboard overview
const { progressPercentage, completedStepsCount } = useJourneyProgress()

// For step management  
const { completeStep, isStepCompleted } = useJourney()

// For regional calculations
const { formatCurrency, calculateClosingCosts } = useRegionalUtils()

// For regional content access
const { steps, getStepsByPhase } = useRegionalSteps()
```

## Data Storage Architecture

BuyRight uses a **dual-persistence strategy** for robust data management:

### Primary Storage: **Supabase PostgreSQL Database**

**Database Tables:**
- `user_profiles` - User profile info (location, budget, timeline preferences)
- `journey_progress` - Home buying journey step completion and progress
- `calculator_sessions` - Saved calculator results and input data
- `home_details` - Post-purchase home information 
- `home_components` - Home maintenance component tracking

**Security Features:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users only access their own data
- User authentication handled by Supabase Auth
- Automatic profile creation on user signup

### Backup Storage: **localStorage (Browser)**

**Used for:**
- Offline functionality when Supabase unavailable
- Unauthenticated user demo mode
- Recent calculator sessions backup
- Journey progress persistence during network issues

### Data Flow Architecture:

```
User Action → Supabase (Primary) → localStorage (Backup)
               ↓                    ↓
            Real-time sync     Offline fallback
```

**File Locations:**
- **AuthContext**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:75` - Manages user profiles in Supabase
- **JourneyContext**: `src/contexts/JourneyContext.tsx:355` - Syncs journey progress to database
- **CalculatorService**: `src/lib/calculator-service.ts:23` - Direct Supabase calculator operations
- **Database Schema**: `supabase-schema.sql` - Complete table structure with RLS

The app uses an **offline-first approach** where all data saves to both Supabase and localStorage, ensuring users never lose their progress even during connectivity issues.

## GitHub Repository Status
- **Latest Commit**: `e43c381 Major: Add comprehensive Google Play-compliant privacy policy and account deletion`
- **Repository**: https://github.com/mikermcconnell/BuyRight.git
- **Development Server**: http://localhost:3005

## 🔒 Checkpoint System Protocol

### Automatic Checkpoint Creation
Claude should automatically create checkpoints in the following situations:

1. **After Major Features** - When completing a significant feature (e.g., new calculator, authentication system)
2. **Before Risky Changes** - Before making breaking changes or major refactoring
3. **Stable States** - After fixing critical bugs and achieving a stable, working state
4. **Milestone Completion** - When completing a phase or major task from the project roadmap
5. **Before Deployments** - Before building for production or mobile deployment

### How to Create Checkpoints
```bash
# Automatic checkpoint (checks if needed based on criteria)
npm run checkpoint:auto

# Manual checkpoint with description
npm run checkpoint:save "Description of current state"

# List all checkpoints
npm run checkpoint:list

# Restore to a checkpoint
npm run checkpoint:restore checkpoint-name
```

### Checkpoint Naming Convention
- Format: `checkpoint-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-mm-ss`
- Example: `checkpoint-2025-08-24T12-51-13`

### When to Use Checkpoints
- ✅ **DO** create checkpoint after successful feature implementation
- ✅ **DO** create checkpoint before experimenting with new libraries/frameworks
- ✅ **DO** create checkpoint when user expresses satisfaction with current state
- ✅ **DO** create checkpoint before user session ends with significant changes
- ❌ **DON'T** create checkpoint when build is broken
- ❌ **DON'T** create checkpoint with uncommitted sensitive data

### Recovery Process
If something goes wrong:
1. List available checkpoints: `npm run checkpoint:list`
2. Restore to last known good state: `npm run checkpoint:restore [checkpoint-name]`
3. Create new branch if needed: `git checkout -b recovery-branch`

This represents a production-ready home buying platform with enterprise-level code quality, comprehensive user guidance, and mobile-first design principles. The application successfully combines educational content with practical tools to guide first-time home buyers through the complex purchasing process.
