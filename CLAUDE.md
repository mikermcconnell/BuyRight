# Claude Code Project Context - BuyRight App

## Project Overview
**BuyRight** is a mobile-first interactive home buying and maintenance platform that guides first-time buyers through the complex process with region-specific step-by-step instructions, progress tracking, and financial calculators.

**Current Status**: 🚀 ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT - Supabase Authentication Implementation  
**Current Task**: Supabase Authentication & Data Storage Integration (Phase 4)

## Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Next.js 14 App Router + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Duolingo-inspired design system (green theme #58CC02)

## 📋 Status Updates Protocol
**IMPORTANT**: After completing each task, always update the project status in two places:
1. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Mark the specific task as completed and update progress
2. **CLAUDE.md** - Update the "Current Task" and "Current Development Status" sections

This ensures continuity across development sessions and accurate progress tracking.

## Immediate Next Steps for Task 3.1
1. Create global journey progress state management system
2. Implement progress persistence logic with localStorage/database sync
3. Add React Context for journey progress tracking
4. Create utilities for step completion and progress calculations
5. Integrate with existing journey engine for seamless progress updates

## Feature Interactions & Data Flow

### Context Architecture Overview
The BuyRight app uses a three-layer context architecture for state management:

1. **RegionalContext** - Location-based content management
2. **JourneyContext** - Progress tracking and journey engine 
3. **UserContext** - User profile management (planned - currently localStorage)

### Data Flow Patterns

#### Regional Context Flow
```
RegionalProvider → currentRegion → JourneyProvider → dashboard/components
    ↓                    ↓              ↓
localStorage      regionalContent   customized steps
    ↓                    ↓              ↓  
optimized cache   tax calculations  region-specific resources
```

#### Journey Context Flow
```
JourneyProvider → JourneyEngine → Dashboard/Steps
     ↓               ↓              ↓
ProgressPersistence → localStorage → API sync (offline-first)
     ↓               ↓              ↓
step completion   progress calc   context updates
```

### Key Integration Points

#### 1. Regional + Journey Integration
- `JourneyContext.useEffect` listens to `currentRegion` changes
- `JourneyEngine` receives `currentRegion` to customize journey phases
- Regional content provides `steps`, `costs`, and `legalRequirements`
- Journey engine merges base template with regional overrides

#### 2. Dashboard Integration Pattern
- Uses both `useJourney()` and `useJourneyProgress()` hooks
- Displays progress from JourneyContext state 
- Shows financial insights from CalculatorIntegrationService
- Updates progress through context actions (`completeStep`, `setCurrentStep`)

#### 3. Persistence Strategy (Offline-First)
- **Primary**: localStorage for immediate access
- **Secondary**: API sync when online (via ProgressPersistence service)
- **Fallback**: Offline queue for failed API calls
- **Recovery**: Auto-sync when connection restored

#### 4. Progress Calculation Flow
```
UserJourneyProgress → JourneyEngine.calculateProgress() → Dashboard display
completedSteps → availableSteps → currentStep → progressPercentage
```

### State Dependencies

#### Critical Dependencies
1. **RegionalContext must initialize first** - Journey depends on currentRegion
2. **Journey engine requires regional content** - For step customization
3. **Progress persistence requires userId** - Currently uses 'demo-user'
4. **Calculator integration is loosely coupled** - Separate service layer

#### Context Interaction Rules
- RegionalContext is provider-independent (no auth needed)
- JourneyContext depends on RegionalContext for initialization
- Both contexts use localStorage for demo mode
- Progress updates trigger both context state + persistence layer

### Data Synchronization
- **Regional content**: Optimized loading with caching (`loadRegionalContentOptimized`)
- **Journey progress**: Enhanced persistence with offline queue (`ProgressPersistence`)
- **Context updates**: Real-time via useReducer actions
- **API integration**: Background sync with graceful degradation

### Hook Usage Patterns
```typescript
// For dashboard overview
const { progressPercentage, completedStepsCount } = useJourneyProgress()

// For step management  
const { completeStep, isStepCompleted } = useJourney()

// For regional calculations
const { formatCurrency, calculateClosingCosts } = useRegionalUtils()

// For regional content access
const { steps, getStepsByPhase } = useRegionalSteps()
```
