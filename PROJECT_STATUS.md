## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
- [ ] **Regional Content Complexity** - Need to validate legal requirements for each region
- [ ] **Mobile Performance** - Ensure smooth animations and fast loading
- [ ] **Data Privacy Compliance** - GDPR/CCPA requirements for user data

### Medium Priority Risks
- [ ] **Calculator Accuracy** - Validate financial calculations across regions
- [ ] **Offline Functionality** - Complex state synchronization requirements
- [ ] **User Onboarding Flow** - Balance simplicity with comprehensive data collection

## Critical Implementation Considerations

### High Priority Risks & Mitigation
- [ ] **Regional Content Complexity** - Most challenging aspect is managing region-specific content variations while maintaining code simplicity. Implement robust content merging system in Phase 2.
- [ ] **Mobile Performance** - Complex journey visualizations and animations must maintain 60fps on lower-end devices. Focus on optimization and lazy loading in Phase 4.
- [ ] **State Management Complexity** - Journey progress, regional context, and calculator data create complex interactions. Use React Context strategically in Phase 3.
- [ ] **Database Performance** - Progress tracking generates many small updates. Optimize for write performance and implement proper indexing.
- [ ] **Progressive Web App Challenges** - Offline functionality with complex state synchronization requires careful planning in Phase 8.

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Journey engine logic, calculator computations, regional content merging, progress tracking utilities
- **Integration Tests:** Authentication flow, journey progress persistence, calculator API endpoints, regional data loading  
- **End-to-End Tests:** Complete user journey from registration to home purchase, calculator workflows, maintenance system
- **Performance Tests:** Page load times on 3G networks, animation frame rates, large dataset handling
- **Accessibility Tests:** Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, color contrast ratios

### Deployment & Rollout Strategy
**Environment Setup:**
1. **Development:** Local PostgreSQL, hot reload, mock regional data
2. **Staging:** Cloud database, real regional data, full PWA features  
3. **Production:** Optimized build, CDN assets, monitoring enabled

**Rollout Plan:**
- **Week 1:** Internal testing with development team
- **Week 2:** Closed beta with 10-15 first-time home buyers
- **Week 3:** Open beta launch in Ontario region only
- **Week 4:** Full launch with all supported regions

## Questions & Clarifications Needed

### Technical Decisions âœ… RESOLVED
- [x] **Hosting Platform Choice** - âœ… **Vercel** (optimal for Next.js deployment, seamless integration)
- [ ] **Regional Data Sources** - Static JSON vs external APIs for real-time cost data
- [x] **Analytics Implementation** - âœ… **Google Analytics** (GA4 with privacy considerations)
- [x] **Database Hosting** - âœ… **Supabase** (managed PostgreSQL with built-in auth and real-time features)

### Business Requirements  
- [x] **Regional Launch Priority** - âœ… **Ontario First** â†’ BC â†’ Major US states (CA, NY, TX, FL)
- [ ] **Maintenance Feature Scope** - Level of detail for home component tracking (basic vs comprehensive)
- [ ] **Export Functionality** - PDF generation vs simple text/JSON export based on user needs
- [ ] **Offline Capabilities** - Which features must work offline vs online-only
